# Collection silero/silero-stt/1
A set of compact enterprise-grade pre-trained STT Models for multiple languages in different formats.

<!-- module-type: audio-stt -->

## Overview

Silero Speech-To-Text models provide enterprise grade STT in a compact form-factor for several commonly spoken languages. Unlike conventional ASR models our models are robust to a variety of dialects, codecs, domains, noises, lower sampling rates (for simplicity audio should be resampled to 16 kHz). The models consume a normalized audio in the form of samples (i.e. without any pre-processing except for normalization to -1 â€¦ 1) and output frames with token probabilities. We provide a decoder utility for simplicity (we could include it into our model itself, but it is hard to do with ONNX for example).

We hope that our efforts with Open-STT and Silero Models will bring the ImageNet moment in speech closer.

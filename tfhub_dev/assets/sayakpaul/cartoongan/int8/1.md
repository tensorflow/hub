### Overview
This variant of CartoonGAN model was proposed in [1]. The model can take an input image (preferably natural images) and cartoonize it in a way such that the resultant image is visually and semantically pleasing. Here is an example result -

### Note
- This model was quantized using `int8` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_integer_quant).
- This model is populated with metadata. 
- This model takes fixed-shaped (520x520) inputs (images with BGR channel ordering). 
- The Colab Notebook that accompanies the model contains conversion and inference steps.

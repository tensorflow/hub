### TF2 SavedModel
This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model). Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

### Overview
The COVID Chest X-Ray model is a lightweight Deep Learning model for image classification where the goal is to predict from a Chest X-Ray if a person might have COVID. The data used for this model was derived from COVID-19 Image DataCollection (Joseph Paul Cohen et. al.) [1].

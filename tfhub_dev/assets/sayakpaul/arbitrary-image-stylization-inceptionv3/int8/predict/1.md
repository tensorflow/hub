### Overview
The original work for artistic style transfer with neural networks proposed a slow optimization algorithm that works on any arbitrary painting. Subsequent work developed a method for fast artistic style transfer that may operate in real time, but was limited to one or a limited set of styles.

This module performs fast artistic style transfer that may work on arbitrary painting styles as described in [1].

### Note
- The TensorFlow Lite models were generated from InceptionV3 based model that produces higher quality stylized images at the expense of latency. For faster TensorFlow Lite models, check out [these](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2).
- Models were quantized using `int8` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization#full_integer_quantization).
- This [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/Adventures-in-TensorFlow-Lite/blob/master/Magenta_arbitrary_style_transfer_model_conversion.ipynb) shows the TensorFLow Lite model conversion process (includes three different post-training quantization schemes).

### Example use
For a good understanding of the model usage follow the
[sample app](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/style_transfer/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/styletransfer/StyleTransferModelExecutor.kt)
usage.

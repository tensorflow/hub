  A ModuleSpec is the blueprint used by `Module` to create one or more instances
  of a specific module in one or more graphs. The details on how to construct
  the Module are internal to the library implementation but methods to inspect
  a Module interface are public.

  Note: Do not instantiate this class directly. Use `hub.load_module_spec` or

    This is an helper to export modules directly from a ModuleSpec
    without having to create a session and set the variables to the
    intended values.

    Example usage:

    ```python
    spec = hub.create_module_spec(module_fn)
    spec.export("/path/to/export_module",
                checkpoint_path="/path/to/training_model")
    ```

    In some cases, the variable name in the checkpoint does not match
    the variable name in the module. It is possible to work around that
    by providing a checkpoint_map_fn that performs the variable mapping.
    For example with: `name_transform_fn = lambda x: "extra_scope/" + x`.

    Args:
      path: path where to export the module to.
      _sentinel: used to prevent positional arguments besides `path`.
      checkpoint_path: path where to load the weights for the module.
        Mandatory parameter and must be passed by name.
      name_transform_fn: optional function to provide mapping between
        variable name in the module and the variable name in the checkpoint.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if missing mandatory `checkpoint_path` parameter.

    Module publishers can attach protocol messages to modules at creation time

    to store a small set of named values with modules of a certain type so

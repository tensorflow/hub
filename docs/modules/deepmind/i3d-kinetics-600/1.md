# Module deepmind/i3d-kinetics-600/1
Inflated 3D Convnet model trained for action recognition on Kinetics-600.

<!-- dataset: Kinetics-600 -->
<!-- module-type: video-classification -->
<!-- network-architecture: I3D -->

**Module URL:** [https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/i3d-kinetics-600/1](https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/i3d-kinetics-600/1)

A Colaboratory notebook demonstrating a simple application of this module is
available
[here](//colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/action_recognition_with_tf_hub.ipynb).

## Overview

This video classification model is described in [1], the source code is publicly
available on [github](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d).

As reported in [1], this model achieved state-of-the-art results on the UCF101
and HMDB51 datasets from fine-tuning these models. I3D models pre-trained on
Kinetics also placed first in the CVPR 2017 [Charades
challenge](http://vuchallenge.org/charades.html).

#### Example use
```python
frames = ... # Shape [batch_size, frame_count, height=224, width=224, 3]
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/i3d-kinetics-600/1")
logits = module(frames)
```

The labels for the 600 different actions are detailed in this
[map](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d/blob/master/data/label_map_600.txt).

A Colaboratory notebook demonstrating a simple application of this module is
available
[here](//colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder_lite.ipynb).

Warning: An updated version of this module is available at
[https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2).

## Overview

The Universal Sentence Encoder Lite module is a lightweight version of
[Universal Sentence Encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1).
This lite version is good for use cases when your computation resource is
limited. For example, on-device inference. It's small and still gives good
performance on various natural language understanding tasks.

The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as
sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data
sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide
variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length
English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to
the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) for
semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder_lite.ipynb) made available.
To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the [TensorFlow Embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/embedding)
documentation. Our encoder differs from word level embedding models in that we
train on a number of natural language prediction tasks that require modeling the
meaning of word sequences rather than just individual words. Details are
available in the paper "Universal Sentence Encoder" [1].

#### Signatures
This module provides two signatures:

  - "default": the sentence encoding signature.
    - inputs: This signature takes IDs produced from SentencePiece processor on
      the input sentences. The IDs should be represened in tf.SparseTensor
      style by three name arguments "values", "indices", and "dense_shape". See
      'process_to_IDs_in_sparse_format()' function in the example below.
    - output: A 512 dimensional vector for each sentences.
  - "spm_path": this signatures returns the path to the SenteicePiece model
      required when processing the sentences. See the next section for details.

#### Prerequisites
You need to process all the sentences with [SentencePiece library](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) and the SentencePiece model published
with the module together. On [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/),
SentencePiece library is available by:

```python
!pip3 install sentencepiece
import sentencepiece
```

To initialize a SentencePiece processor with the SentencePiece model published
with the module together:

```python
with tf.Session() as sess:
  module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/1")
  spm_path = sess.run(module(signature="spm_path"))
  # spm_path now contains a path to the SentencePiece model stored inside the
  # TF-Hub module

sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
sp.Load(spm_path)
```

#### Example use

```python
import sentencepiece as spm

def process_to_IDs_in_sparse_format(sp, sentences):
  # An utility method that processes sentences with the sentence piece processor
  # 'sp' and returns the results in tf.SparseTensor-similar format:
  # (values, indices, dense_shape)
  ids = [sp.EncodeAsIds(x) for x in sentences]
  max_len = max(len(x) for x in ids)
  dense_shape=(len(ids), max_len)
  values=[item for sublist in ids for item in sublist]
  indices=[[row,col] for row in range(len(ids)) for col in range(len(ids[row]))]
  return (values, indices, dense_shape)

sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
sp.Load("/path/to/sentence_piece/model")

module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/1")
sentences = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding"]

input_placeholder = tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.int64, shape=[None, None])
embeddings = module(
    inputs=dict(
        values=input_placeholder.values,
        indices=input_placeholder.indices,
        dense_shape=input_placeholder.dense_shape))

values, indices, dense_shape = process_to_IDs_in_sparse_format(sentences)

message_embeddings = session.run(
      embeddings,
      feed_dict={input_placeholder.values: values,
                input_placeholder.indices: indices,
                input_placeholder.dense_shape: dense_shape})

print(message_embeddings)

# The following are example embedding output of 512 dimensions per sentence
# Embedding for: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
# [0.0560572519898, 0.0534118898213, -0.0112254749984, ...]
# Embedding for: I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding.
# [-0.0343746766448, -0.0529498048127, 0.0469399243593, ...]

### Overview
DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g. person, dog, cat) to every pixel in the input image. It was published in [1].

### Note
- The TensorFlow Lite model was generated from [`mobilenetv2_dm05_coco_voc_trainval`](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/deeplabv3_mnv2_dm05_pascal_trainval_2018_10_01.tar.gz) checkpoint. More information about the different DeepLabV3 checkpoints is available [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/g3doc/model_zoo.md).
- The model is metadata populated which makes it extremely easier for mobile application developers to consume this model in their applications. Know more about TFLite metadata from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/metadata). 
- This model was quantized using _dynamic range quantization_ as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).
- Example usage (in Python) and TensorFlow Lite conversion process are demonstrated in the accompanying Colab Notebook.

### Example use
For a good understanding of the model usage check out this [sample application](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_segmentation/android).

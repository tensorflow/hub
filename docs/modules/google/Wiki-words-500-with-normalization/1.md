# Module google/&zwnj;Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1
Token based text embedding trained on English Wikipedia corpus[1].

<!-- module-type: text-embedding -->
<!-- network-architecture: word2vec skip-gram -->
<!-- dataset: Wikipedia -->
<!-- language: en -->

**Module URL:** [https://tfhub.dev/google/Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1)

## Overview

Text embedding based on skipgram version of word2vec with 1 out-of-vocabulary
bucket. Maps from text to 500-dimensional embedding vectors.

#### Example use
```
embed = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1")
embeddings = embed(["cat is on the mat", "dog is in the fog"])
```

## Details
Skipgram model, hierarchical softmax, sub-sampling 1e-5.

#### Input
The module takes **a batch of sentences in a 1-D tensor of strings** as input.

#### Preprocessing
The module preprocesses its input by **removing punctuation and splitting on spaces**.

#### Out of vocabulary tokens
Module maps all out-of-vocabulary tokens into one bucket that is initialized
with zeros.

#### Sentence embeddings
Word embeddings are combined into sentence embedding using the `sqrtn` combiner
(see [tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/nn/embedding_lookup_sparse)).

### TF2 SavedModel
This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model). Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

### Overview
The COVID Chest X-Ray model is a lightweight Deep Learning model for image classification where the goal is to predict from a Chest X-Ray if a person might have COVID. The data used for this model was derived from COVID-19 Image DataCollection (Joseph Paul Cohen et. al.) [1].

### Model Performance
The model was tested on 10 % of the the complete dataset, currently the model is optimized for reducing false-positives as much as possible since this would be highly detrimental.

#### Precison/ Recall Curve

#### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix for trained lite model, also shows that the final precison and recall was ~97.37 % on the dataset.

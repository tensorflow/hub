### Overview
The COVID Chest X-Ray model is a lightweight Deep Learning model for image classification where the goal is to predict from a Chest X-Ray if a person might have COVID. The data used for this model was derived from COVID-19 Image DataCollection (Joseph Paul Cohen et. al.) [1].

### Usage

#### Input

The model accepts 224 x 224 images with 3 color channels.

#### Output

The model returns a tensor of `scores` with score for each label


#### Example Usage

A sample usage of the model with an Android app using the ML Model Binding Plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Code-to-Learn-2020/releases/download/v1.0.0/android_demo.tar.gz) .

Java code:

```java
File tfliteModel = new File("***.tflite");
Interpreter tflite = new Interpreter(tfliteModel);  // Load model.
final int IMAGE_SIZE_X = 224;
final int IMAGE_SIZE_Y = 224;
final int DIM_BATCH_SIZE = 1;
final int DIM_PIXEL_SIZE = 3;
final int NUM_BYTES_PER_CHANNEL = 1;
// The example uses Bitmap ARGB_8888 format.
Bitmap bitmap = ...;
int[] intValues = new int[IMAGE_SIZE_X * IMAGE_SIZE_Y];
bitmap.getPixels(intValues, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), 0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight());
ByteBuffer imgData =
    ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(
        DIM_BATCH_SIZE
            * IMAGE_SIZE_X
            * IMAGE_SIZE_Y
            * DIM_PIXEL_SIZE
            * NUM_BYTES_PER_CHANNEL);
imgData.rewind();
// Quantized model.
int pixel = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < IMAGE_SIZE_X; ++i) {
  for (int j = 0; j < IMAGE_SIZE_Y; ++j) {
    int pixelValue = intValues[pixel++];
    imgData.put((byte) ((pixelValue >> 16) & 0xFF));
    imgData.put((byte) ((pixelValue >> 8) & 0xFF));
    imgData.put((byte) (pixelValue & 0xFF));
  }
}
// Output label probabilities.
float[][] labelProbArray = new float[1][NUM_CLASS];
// Run the model.
tflite.run(imgData, labelProbArray);
// Close the interpreter to avoid leaking resources.
tflite.close()
```

### Model Performance
The model was tested on 10 % of the the complete dataset, currently the model is optimized for reducing false-positives as much as possible since this would be highly detrimental.

#### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix for trained lite model, also shows that the final precison and recall was ~97.37 % on the dataset.

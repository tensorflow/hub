## I want to see what I’ve uploaded to TensorFlow Hub. Can I get a copy of my data?

Yes. If you’d like the TensorFlow Hub team to **send you a copy** of all of the
data you have uploaded, please send us an email at [hi-tf-hub@google.com](mailto:hi-tf-hub@google.com)
and we’ll respond as soon as possible.


## How do I delete what I’ve uploaded to TensorFlow Hub?

Similarly, if you’d like us to **delete or remove content**, please send us an
email at [hi-tf-hub@google.com](mailto:hi-tf-hub@google.com) and we’ll delete
all copies that we have and stop serving it on tfhub.dev. Please note:

*   Because TensorFlow Hub is an open-source platform, copies of your assets may
still be retained by members of the public.
*   Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
*   Deletion can cause downstream breakages if users are not caching your model
locally and/or are not properly warned prior to deletion.

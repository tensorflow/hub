### Overview
This variant of CartoonGAN model was proposed in [1]. The model can take an input image (preferably natural images) and cartoonize it in a way such that the resultant image is visually and semantically pleasing. Here is an example result -

### Note
- This model was quantized using `float16` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_float16_quant).
- This model is populated with metadata.
- This model takes fixed-shaped (224x224) inputs (images with BGR channel ordering).
- The Colab Notebook that accompanies the model contains conversion and inference steps.
- The model currently does not run on TFLite GPU Delegate and this is a known limitation. We recommend using the dynamic range and `int8` quantized models if you are looking for speed as well as good results.

### Example use
For a good understanding of the model usage keep an eye out on (this repo)[https://github.com/margaretmz/CartoonGAN-e2e-tflite-tutorial].

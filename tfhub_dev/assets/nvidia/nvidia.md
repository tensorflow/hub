## [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com)
NVIDIA‘s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming
market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionized parallel
computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of
computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots and
self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

NVIDIA is a company built upon great minds and groundbreaking research. With
more than 120 scientists around the globe, the
[areas of focus](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/about/) include AI,
self-driving cars, high-performance computing, graphics, VR, and augmented
reality. Our researchers operate as a think tank, accelerating advances in
product technologies, including AI innovations like facial animations and light
transport.

NVIDIA offers researchers and developers several GPU-accelerated modules for
computer vision, NLU and speech on TensorFlow Hub. You can use these optimized
pre-trained models to build state of the art AI applications easily.

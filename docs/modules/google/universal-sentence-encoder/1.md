# Module google/universal-sentence-encoder/1

**Module URL:** [https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1)

A Colaboratory notebook demonstrating a simple application of this module is
available
[here](//colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/r0.1/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb).

## Overview

The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high dimensional vectors that
can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other
natural language tasks.

The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as
sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data
sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide
variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length
English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to
the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) for
semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/r0.1/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb) made available.
To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the [TensorFlow Embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding)
documentation. Our encoder differs from word level embedding models in that we
train on a number of natural language prediction tasks that require modeling the
meaning of word sequences rather than just individual words. Details are
available in the paper "Universal Sentence Encoder" [1].

#### Example use

```python
embed = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1")
embeddings = embed([
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding"])

print session.run(embeddings)

# The following are example embedding output of 512 dimensions per sentence
# Embedding for: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
# [-0.016987282782793045, -0.008949815295636654, -0.0070627182722091675, ...]
# Embedding for: I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding.
# [0.03531332314014435, -0.025384284555912018, -0.007880025543272495, ...]
```

## Semantic Similarity

![Semantic Similarity Graphic](images/example-similarity.png)

Semantic similarity is a measure of the degree to which two pieces of text carry
the same meaning. This is broadly useful in obtaining good coverage over the
numerous ways that a thought can be expressed using language without needing to
manually enumerate them.

Simple applications include improving the coverage of systems that trigger
behaviors on certain keywords, phrases or utterances.
[This section of the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/r0.1/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb#scrollTo=BnvjATdy64eR)
shows how to encode text and compare encoding distances as a proxy for semantic
similarity.

## Classification

![Text Classification Graphic](images/example-classification.png)

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/r0.1/docs/tutorials/text_classification_with_tf_hub.ipynb)

shows how to train a simple binary text classifier on top of any TF-Hub module
that can embed sentences. The Universal Sentence Encoder was partly trained with
custom text classification tasks in mind. It can be trained to perform a wide
variety of classification tasks often with a very small amount of labeled
examples.

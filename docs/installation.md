# Installation

TensorFlow Hub depends on bug fixes and enhancements not present in TensorFlow
releases prior to `1.7`. You must [install or
upgrade](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) your TensorFlow package to at
least `1.7` to use TensorFlow Hub:

```bash
$ pip install "tensorflow>=1.7.0"
$ pip install tensorflow-hub
```

This section will be updated to include a specific TensorFlow version
requirement when a compatible release is made available.

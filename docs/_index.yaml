        TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and
        consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A
        <em>module</em> is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph, along
        with its weights and assets, that can be reused across different tasks in
        a process known as transfer learning. Transfer learning can:

          <li>Train a model with a smaller dataset,</li>
          <li>Improve generalization, and</li>
          <li>Speed up training.</li>

# Module google/nnlm-en-dim128/1
Token based text embedding trained on English Google News 200B corpus.

**Module URL:** [https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128/1)

## Overview

Text embedding based on feed-forward Neural-Net Language Models[1] with
pre-built OOV. Maps from text to 128-dimensional embedding vectors.

#### Example use
```
embed = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim128/1")
embeddings = embed(["cat is on the mat", "dog is in the fog"])
```

## Details
Based on NNLM with two hidden layers.

#### Input
The module takes **a batch of sentences in a 1-D tensor of strings** as input.

#### Preprocessing
The module preprocesses its input by **splitting on spaces**.

#### Out of vocabulary tokens
Small fraction of the least frequent tokens and embeddings (~2.5%) are
**replaced by hash buckets**. Each hash bucket is initialized using the remaining
embedding vectors that hash to the same bucket.

#### Sentence embeddings
Word embeddings are combined into sentence embedding using the `sqrtn` combiner
(see [https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/nn/embedding_lookup_sparse](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/nn/embedding_lookup_sparse)).

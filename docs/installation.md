# Installation and usage notes

## Installing tensorflow_hub

The `tensorflow_hub` library can be installed alongside TensorFlow 1 and
TensorFlow 2. We recommend that new users start with TensorFlow 2 right away,
and current users upgrade to it.

### Use with TensorFlow 2

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) to
[install TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) as usual. (See there
for extra instructions about GPU support.) Then install a current version of
[`tensorflow-hub`](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-hub/) next to it (must be
0.5.0 or newer).

```bash
$ pip install "tensorflow>=2.0.0"
$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow-hub
```

The TF1-style API of TensorFlow Hub works with the v1 compatibility mode of
TensorFlow 2.

### Legacy use with TensorFlow 1

The `tensorflow_hub` library requires TensorFlow version 1.7 or greater.

We strongly recommend to install it with TensorFlow 1.15, which defaults to
TF1-compatible behavior but contains many TF2 features under the hood to allow
some use of TensorFlow Hub's TF2-style APIs.

```bash
$ pip install "tensorflow>=1.15,<2.0"
$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow-hub
```

### Use of pre-release versions

The pip packages `tf-nightly` and `tf-hub-nightly` are built automatically from
the source code on github, with no release testing. This lets developers try out
the latest code without [building from source](build_from_source.md).

## API stability

Although we hope to prevent breaking changes, this project is still under active
development and is not yet guaranteed to have a stable API or model format.

## Fairness

As in all of machine learning, [fairness](http://ml-fairness.com) is an
[important](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/10/equality-of-opportunity-in-machine.html)
consideration. Many pre-trained models are trained on large datasets. When
reusing any model, itâ€™s important to be mindful of what data the model was
trained on (and whether there are any existing biases there), and how these
might impact your use of it.

## Security

Since they contain arbitrary TensorFlow graphs, models can be thought of as
programs.
[Using TensorFlow Securely](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
describes the security implications of referencing a model from an untrusted
source.

# Text Cookbook

This page lists a set of known guides and tools solving problems in the text
domain with TensorFlow Hub. It is a starting place for anybody who wants to
solve typical ML problems using pre-trained ML components rather than starting
from scratch.

## Classification

When we want to predict a class for a given example, for example **sentiment**,
**toxicity**, **article category**, or any other characteristic.

The tutorials below are solving the same task from different perspectives and
using different tools.

### Estimator

example for building an IMDB sentiment classifier with Estimator. Contains
multiple tips for improvement and a module comparison section.

### Keras

[Text classification with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification_with_hub) -

Datasets.

### BERT
[Predicting Movie Review Sentiment with BERT on TF Hub](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/predicting_movie_reviews_with_bert_on_tf_hub.ipynb) -
shows how to use a BERT module for classification. Includes use of `bert`
library for tokenization and preprocessing.

### Kaggle
[IMDB classification on Kaggle](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/text_classification_with_tf_hub_on_kaggle.ipynb) - shows how to easily interact with a Kaggle competition from a Colab,
including downloading the data and submitting the results.

### Bangla task with FastText embeddings
TensorFlow Hub does not currently offer a module in every language. The
following tutorial shows how to leverage TensorFlow Hub for fast experimentation
and modular ML development.

[Bangla Article Classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/bangla_article_classifier.ipynb) -
demonstrates how to create a reusable TensorFlow Hub text embedding, and use it
to train a Keras classifier for
[BARD Bangla Article dataset](https://github.com/tanvirfahim15/BARD-Bangla-Article-Classifier).

## Semantic similarity

When we want to find out which sentences correlate with each other in zero-shot
setup (no training examples).

![Semantic Similarity Graphic](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/universal-sentence-encoder/example-similarity.png)

### Basic
[Semantic similarity](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb) - shows how to use the sentence encoder module to compute sentence
similarity.

### Cross-lingual
[Cross-lingual semantic similarity](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/cross_lingual_similarity_with_tf_hub_multilingual_universal_encoder.ipynb) - shows how to use one of the cross-lingual sentence
encoders to compute sentence similarity across languages.

### Semantic retrieval
[Semantic retrieval](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/retrieval_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder_qa.ipynb) - shows how to use Q/A sentence encoder to index a collection of documents
for retrieval based on semantic similarity.

### SentencePiece input
[Semantic similarity with universal encoder lite](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder_lite.ipynb) - shows how to use sentence encoder modules that accept
[SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) ids on input instead of
text.


## Module creation
Instead of using only modules on [tfhub.dev](https://tfhub.dev), there are ways
to create own modules. This can be a useful tool for better ML codebase
modularity and for further sharing.

### Wrapping existing pre-trained embeddings
[Text embedding module exporter](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/text_embeddings/export.py) -
a tool to wrap an existing pre-trained embedding into a module. Shows how to
include text pre-processing ops into the module. This allows to create a
sentence embedding module from token embeddings.

[Text embedding module exporter v2](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/text_embeddings_v2/export_v2.py) -
same as above, but compatible with TensorFlow 2 and eager execution.

### Create trainable RNN module
[RNN model exporter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/saved_model/integration_tests/export_text_rnn_model.py) -
shows how to create an uninitialized trainable LSTM based module compatible with
TensorFlow 2. The module exposes two signatures, one for training by directly
feeding in sentences, the other for decoding - constructing a statistically most
likely sentence.

### About CRAFT

The CRAFT model is a text detector that effectively detect text area by exploring each character region and affinity between characters. The bounding box of texts are obtained by simply finding minimum bounding rectangles on binary map after thresholding character region and affinity scores.

- Model was quantized using `dynamic range` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- The Colab Notebook contains further information on running this model in real-time settings.

- Original model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch)

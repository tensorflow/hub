# TensorFlow Hub Library Overview

The [`tensorflow_hub`](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub) library lets you
download and reuse trained models in your TensorFlow program with a minimum
amount of code. The main way to load a trained model is using the
`hub.KerasLayer` API.

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub

embed = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim128/1")
embeddings = embed(["A long sentence.", "single-word", "http://example.com"])
print(embeddings.shape, embeddings.dtype)
```

## Setting the cache location for downloads.

By default, `tensorflow_hub` uses a system-wide, temporary directory to cache
downloaded and uncompressed models. See [Caching](caching.md) for options to use
other, possibly more persistent locations.

## API stability

Although we hope to prevent breaking changes, this project is still under active
development and is not yet guaranteed to have a stable API or model format.

## Fairness

As in all of machine learning, [fairness](http://ml-fairness.com) is an
[important](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/10/equality-of-opportunity-in-machine.html)
consideration. Many pre-trained models are trained on large datasets. When
reusing any model, itâ€™s important to be mindful of what data the model was
trained on (and whether there are any existing biases there), and how these
might impact your use of it.

## Security

Since they contain arbitrary TensorFlow graphs, models can be thought of as
programs.
[Using TensorFlow Securely](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
describes the security implications of referencing a model from an untrusted
source.
